\section{Conclusions}
\section{Future Work}

%For future work, it would be very interesting to see the results of a study that would take place in more companies in order to compare the results of this one and check if the results corroborate. Moreover, another way of forming the data samples could indicate different results which would be worth seeing. In addition, future work on the field could check for correlations of other agility measurement tools which were presented in the~\ref{ch:related_work} chapter. Finally, the enhancements made in \ac{OPS} should be validated to check whether it measures agility better or not.
