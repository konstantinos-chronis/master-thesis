\chapter{Effectiveness Questions for Company F's Teams}

{\large \textbf{To what rate are the following implemented?}}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Iterative Progression {\footnotesize (Develop the product over several iterations/cycles in sequence)}
	\item Incremental Development {\footnotesize (Create the product incrementally. Develop only a selected/prioritized set of bugs/enhancements during a release cycle)}
	\item Short Delivery Cycles {\footnotesize (Deliver valuable software frequently)}
	\item Evolutionary Requirements {\footnotesize (Allow the features/requirements to evolve over the development lifecycle)}
	\item Refactoring {\footnotesize (Refine the architecture, design, code, and/or other process artifacts regularly to improve the quality of that artifact)}
	\item Self-Managing Teams {\footnotesize(Allow the team members to determine, plan, and manage their day-to-day activities and duties under reduced or no supervision)}
	\item Continuous Integration {\footnotesize(Team members integrate their work frequently; usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible)}
	\item Minimal Documentation {\footnotesize (Maintain just-enough documentation to satisfy the needs of the development team and the customer)}
	\item High-bandwidth communication {(Facilitate continuous communication among the (developers, testers, customers) (in-person, face-to-face interactions))}
	\item Client-driven iterations {\footnotesize (The customers and users prioritize the bugs/enhancements. Build only what is of value to the customers and users)} 
	\item Appropriate distribution of expertise {\footnotesize (Select the right people to complete the tasks. Ensure that the team is composed of people with the appropriate skill sets to complete the assigned tasks)}
	\item Configuration Management {\footnotesize (Manage the evolution of the product and other artifacts, both during the initial stages of development and during all stages of maintenance)}
	\item Adherence to Standards {\footnotesize (Conform to a set of standards that the team or organization has agreed to comply with,  e.g. Coding standards.)}
