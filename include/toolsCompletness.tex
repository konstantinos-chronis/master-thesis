\chapter{Measuring Agility More Completely}
\label{ch:enhancing_ops}

\lettrine[lines=2, loversize=-0.1, lraise=0.1]{T}{his} chapter makes an effort to combine \ac{PAM}, \ac{TAA} and \ac{OPS} in a more enhanced one, based on \ac{OPS}'s structure.

\textbf{Chapter not finished}

\section{Introduction}
As it was discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:tools_completeness_analysis}, \ac{OPP} and subsequently \ac{OPS} covers all the practices and areas of both \ac{PAM} and \ac{TAA}. In this chapter, there will be an effort to combine the tools in a way to provide a more complete tool in measuring agility.

\section{\ac{OPS} Enhancement}
The combination of the tools took place based on the analysis performed in Section~\ref{subsec:tools_completeness_analysis}. Since \ac{OPS} is more complete, it was selected to remain as it is and be enhanced with the questions from \ac{PAM} and \ac{TAA} which have been transformed to match the style of \ac{OPS}.

Although the case study performed in Section~\ref{sec:method} used only the ``Effectiveness" survey from \ac{OPS}, it was selected to enhance the ``Capability" part as well, since some of the \ac{PAM} and \ac{TAA} questions fit there more.

\subsection{Questions Excluded}
The questions excluded belong only to \ac{TAA}. Most of them were referring to product ownership and were needless, since \ac{OPS} focuses on measuring teams practising agile development methods like eXtreme Programming, Crystal, First Driven Development and not agile project management methods like Scrum. The other question excluded was about iteration defects being fixed within the iteration. Although a software without defects is always welcome, trying to mitigate all of them throws away some of the team's agility, since the release could be delayed. Defects should be fixed with a delay in the software's release only if they are a stopper for the business of the customer.

\subsection{Questions Added}
The questions which already existed in \ac{OPS} remained as they were, apart from the question ``To what extent are the code bases not shared" which was changed based on the reasons described in Section~\ref{subsec:opposite_questions}. The questions which were added, were formulated and positioned under the appropriate \ac{OPS} indicator. When an indicator did not cover the questions added, a new one was created. The \ac{OPS} questions follow the pattern of starting a question with the phrase ``To what extent \dots ". The same pattern was used in the additional questions. In Table~\ref{table:summary_questions_added}, one can see the number of indicators and questions added. 

\begin{table} [H]
	\caption{Summary of Indicators and Questions Added}
	\label{table:summary_questions_added}
	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |} \hline
		 & \textbf{Indicators Introduced} & \textbf{Questions Introduced} \\ \hline
		 \textbf{Capability} & 3 & 7 \\ \hline
		 \textbf{Effectiveness} & 9 & 46 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In total, 11 indicators and 53 questions were introduced. The questions did not exist in \ac{OPS} and they cover a variety of aspects which were considered important by the creators of \ac{PAM} and \ac{TAA}. The \ac{OPS} now has in total 46 indicators and 77 questions for ``Capability" and 45 indicators and 126 questions for ``Effectiveness". Although \ac{OPS} supports 17 strategies, and ``Velocity" is one of them, it was not used in the surveys. On the contrary, questions in \ac{PAM} and \ac{TAA} supported this strategy and thus it was added in both ``Capability" and ``Effectiveness". In Table~\ref{table:numbers_enhanced_ops}, one can see in more details the numbers of indicators and questions for each strategy. In Appendix~\ref{ch:ops_pam_taa}, one can see the enhanced \ac{OPS}. Below is the list of symbols that describe the type of addition.

\section{Chapter Summary}
In this chapter there was an effort to enhance \ac{OPS} with questions from \ac{PAM} and \ac{TAA}. The questions added cover \ac{OPS}'s weaknesses. After the changes, \ac{OPS} has in total 46 indicators and 77 questions for ``Capability" and 45 indicators and 126 questions for ``Effectiveness".
