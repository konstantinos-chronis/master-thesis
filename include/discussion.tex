%describe why it is difficult to measure. Companies adjust the methods to their needs. This is good, but the custom solutions are not measurable always Search for difficulties in agile or transitioning to agile. Difficulties in transition make people not adopting well the method and the practices.

\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Unkwown}

The agile philosophy became widely known to the Software Engineering community through the agile manifesto \cite{beck2001agile} which was also listed in the Introduction of this document. Along with the four pillars of the manifesto lie 12 principles \cite{agile_principles} which try to provide to people a better understanding of what agile means. All of them combined, consist the essence of what it is to be Agile \cite{agile_alliance}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
    \item Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
    \item Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
    \item Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
    \item Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    \item The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
    \item Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    \item Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    \item Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
    \item Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
    \item The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
    \item At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
\end{itemize}

Considering that the agile manifesto and its principles are the meaning of agility, then how well do the tools measuring agility succeed in doing so based on them?
