\chapter{Direct Match Questions}
\label{ch:direct_match_questions}

For answering the research questions of this Master's Thesis the \textit{Effectiveness} part of \ac{OPS} was filled in by the employees of company A. Some of the direct match questions though exist in both \textit{Capability} and \textit{Effectiveness} parts. As a result the questions following below are separated based on which \ac{OPS} part they belong.
