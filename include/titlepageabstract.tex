\begin{abstract}

\paragraph{Context:} 
The past two decades more and more software development teams transition to agile. As a result, a need has emerged on measuring how agile are these teams. To satisfy this need many researchers have created their agile measurement tools without any of them giving a substantial solution though.

\paragraph{Objective:} 
Many tools have been created for measuring the agility of software development teams creating a saturation in the field. Three tools were selected in order to validate whether they measure agility in the same way. These tools were Perceptive Agile Measurement (PAM), Team Agility Assessment (TAA) and Objectives Principles Strategies (OPS).

\paragraph{Method:} 
The surveys of the three tools were given to the 4 software development teams of company A. The survey questions were grouped in agile practices which were checked for correlation in order to establish convergent validity. In addition, we checked whether the questions identified to be the same among the tools would have the same answers. Moreover the coverage of agile practices was analysed by checking which tool covers more agile practices. The results were used to see whether the three tools measure agility in the same way.

\paragraph{Results:} 
The correlations of the data gathered were very few and very low. As a result, convergent validity could not be established. In addition, the questions which were identified as the same among the tools did not have the same answers from the respondents. Moreover, \ac{OPS} was the tool covering the most agile practices. The above, provide evidence that the three tools do not measure agility in the same way.

\paragraph{Conclusion:} 
We conclude that the area of measuring agility is still fertile and more work needs to be done. Based on the various agile practices covered by each tool, we believe that not all tools are applicable to every team but they should be selected based on how a team has transitioned to agile. This study has set a milestone in the area and pinpoints the need for a better way for measuring agility.
