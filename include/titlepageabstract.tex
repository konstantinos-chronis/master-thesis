\section*{Acknowledgements}
%I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Richard Torkar and phd student Lucas Gren for all their help and support during the period I was conducting my master thesis. I want to thank Nick Tsivranidis for allowing me to conduct the case study to his company. I want to thank my parents for offering me the chance to study and become what I am. Most of all, I want to thank my girlfriend Tanja, for constantly supporting me and believing in me even when I stopped believing in myself. \\[1cm]
