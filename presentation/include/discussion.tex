\section{Answers to Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Will PAM, TAA and OPS yield similar results? \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{No. The tools measure the agility of teams in their own way}}
	\newcounter{enumTemp}
    \setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
	\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
		\item Does convergent validity exist among the tools? \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{No}}
		\item Will the questions that are exactly the same among the tools yield the same results? \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{No}}
		\item What is the coverage of agile practices among the tools? \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Different practices are covered, while the number of questions is not the same for each tool}}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reasons}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Few or no questions for measuring a practice
	\item The same practice is measured differently
	\item The same practice is measured by opposite questions
	\item Questions phrasing
	\item Survey answering
	\item Better understanding of agile concepts
	\item How people perceive agility
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{\theenumTemp}
	\item Can the tools be combined in a way that will provide a better approach to measuring agility? \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{They have been combined but it needs validation}}
\end{enumerate}
