\section{Answers to Research Questions}

\subsection{RQ \#1}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Will PAM, TAA and OPS yield similar results? \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{No. The tools measure the agility of teams in their own way}}
	\newcounter{enumTemp}
    \setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
	\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
		\item Does convergent validity exist among the tools? \textcolor{red}{\textbf{No}}
		\item Will the questions that are exactly the same among the tools yield the same results? \textcolor{red}{\textbf{No}}
		\item What is the coverage of agile practices among the tools? \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Different practices are covered, while the number of questions is not the same for each tool}}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reasons}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Few or no questions for measuring a practice
	\item The same practice is measured differently
	\item The same practice is measured by opposite questions
	\item Questions phrasing
	\item Survey answering
	\item Better understanding of agile concepts
	\item How people perceive agility
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Few or no questions for measuring a practice}

The \textit{Smaller and Frequent Product Releases} practice is covered by

\begin{itemize}
	\item 1 question in PAM
	\item 1 question in TAA
	\item 4 questions in OPS
\end{itemize}

\textit{Appropriate Distribution of Expertise} is not covered at all by PAM

\clearpage

\subsubsection{The same practice is measured differently}

For the \textit{Refactoring} practice 

\begin{itemize}
	\item PAM checks whether there are enough unit tests and automated system tests to allow the safe code refactoring
	\item TAA and OPS check how often the teams refactor, among other things
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsubsection{The same practice is measured by opposite questions}

For the \textit{Continuous Integration}

\begin{itemize}
	\item TAA and PAM check if the team has synced to the latest code
	\item OPS checks the exact opposite
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Questions phrasing}

For the \textit{Test Driven Development} practice

\begin{itemize}
	\item PAM checks for automated code coverage
	\item TAA checks for 100\% automated code coverage
	\item OPS checks for the existence of code coverage
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Survey answering}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Surveys are affected by the comprehension and the assessment of a question \cite{Wagner_Zeglovits}
	\item People misunderstand questions
	\item A person's judgement is subjective
	\item People try to look good to the survey reader \cite{feldt_angelis_torkar_samuelsson}
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Better understanding of agile concepts}

In pre-post studies there is a possibility of the subjects becoming more aware of a problem in the second test as a result of the first one

\clearpage

\subsubsection{How people perceive agility}

\begin{itemize}
	\item People do not seem to understand the agility concept
	\item Teams implement agile methodologies differently
	\item If the agile experts perceive agility differently, then so do the software development teams
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RQ \#2}

\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{\theenumTemp}
	\item Can the tools be combined in a way that will provide a better approach to measuring agility? \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{They have been combined, but validation is required}}
\end{enumerate}
