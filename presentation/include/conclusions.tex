\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Tools claiming to measure agility do not yield similar results
	\item A measurement tool which satisfies the needs of one team may not be suitable for other teams  
\end{itemize}

%\textbf{Reasons}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item The perception of agility and the personal experience of the tool creators
%	\item Teams have different needs and transition differently to agile methodologies
%\end{itemize}
