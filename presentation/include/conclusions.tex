\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Tools claiming to measure agility do not yield similar results
	\item A measurement tool which satisfies the needs of one team may not be suitable for other teams  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reasons}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The perception of agility and the personal experience of the tool creators
	\item Teams have different needs and different transition to agile methodologies
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Perform the study in other companies and compare the results
	\item Form the data samples in another way

	\item Validate the enhancements made in OPS
\end{itemize}
