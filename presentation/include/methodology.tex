\begin{enumerate}
	\item Will PAM, TAA and OPS yield similar results?
	%by changing into "Roman" you will get capital letters
	\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
  		\item Does convergent validity exist among the tools?
  		\item Will the questions that are exactly the same among the tools yield the same results?
		\item What is the coverage of agile practices among the tools?
	\end{enumerate}	
  	\item Can the tools be combined in a way that will provide a better approach to measuring agility?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Methodology}

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Study in Company $A$}

United States company which activates in the Point Of Sales (POS) area. \\
Development and QA departments (4 mixed teams). \\

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Data Collection}

Company $A$ employees were asked to fill in the surveys created by PAM, TAA and OPS (Effectiveness part) during a 3-week period. The surveys were on 1-7 Likert scale except from the \textit{Collocation} practice which was on a Likert scale 1-5.
Practices which were not used by Company $A$ were excluded from the surveys.

%\textbf{Excluded practices}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Retrospection
%	\item Daily stand-up meetings
%	\item Product Ownership
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Preparation}

\subsubsection{Problem}
All the tools have different amount of questions and cover different practices

\subsubsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Mapping of practices between tools --- OPS covers more practices
	\item Mapping of questions based on the OPS practices
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
	\item ``Spearman's rank correlation coefficient" for checking whether there is a correlation among the practices (convergent validity establishment)
	\item Identified which questions were the same among the tools and checked whether they had the same answer by the respondents. \\ Used ``Mann-Whitney U test" and ``Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance" for statistical tests
	\item Checked which of the tools cover more agile practices and have more questions for a practice by picking the most popular according to two case studies \cite{Williams_Microsoft, laurie_williams}. In addition, made the checks for practices which were covered by the tools, but did not exist or were not popular in the case studies.
